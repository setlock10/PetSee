             <h1>Information About PetSee</h1>
             <h2 >PetSee is a student project from Flatiron School that that was created using React during Phase 2 of the Software Engineering program. It was created by students who love animals and want to not just see cute animals, but to help them! This project displays a list of animals for adoption and gives some important information about each of them. You can filter results to see Dogs or Cats. You can also filter results to see only pets that are good with children. This feature works so that you can see only cats who are good with children, or dogs who are good with children. You can also fill out a form to inquire about a pet you would like to adopt.</h2>
